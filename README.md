# Small E-commerce App with Products and Shopping Cart

This project is a simple e-commerce application featuring a list of books as products and a shopping cart system. It demonstrates the use of modern technologies such as microservices architecture, containerization, and orchestration using Terraform and Docker.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Two FastAPI services (Books Backend and Cart Backend) handling separate functionalities.
- **Frontend**: Built with React (Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistent storage of books, cart data, and user-specific orders.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managed using Terraform to spin up and orchestrate services seamlessly.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: All services are containerized and run on a Docker network.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Two FastAPI microservices:
  - Books Backend: Manages product (books) inventory.
  - Cart Backend: Manages user cart and handles API calls to reserve/release products.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing books, cart data, and user-specific information.
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all services.
- **Orchestration**: Terraform for managing infrastructure and networking.

## Running the Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Terraform** must be installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Navigate to the terraform directory:

cd ./terraform

Initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Plan the infrastructure:

terraform plan

Apply the infrastructure configuration:

  terraform apply

Terraform will:

  Spin up two FastAPI containers (Books Backend and Cart Backend).
  Start the MongoDB container with initialized scripts.
  Launch the React frontend (Vite) container.
  Connect all containers on a Docker network.

### Accessing the App

### Highlights of the Architecture

  Microservices: The backend is split into two independent services (Books and Cart), communicating over APIs. This modular design ensures scalability and maintainability.
  Single Docker Network: All services are connected on a Docker network for seamless communication.
  Terraform: Infrastructure is defined as code, making it easier to manage, scale, and reproduce environments.
  MongoDB Integration: Each backend service interacts with MongoDB to handle data persistence.

### Future Enhancements

  Upgrade store with delivery service
  Add user authentication and multi-user support.
  Implement Kafka for event-driven communication between backend services.
  Migrate the frontend to Next.js for better SEO and performance.
  Add CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
